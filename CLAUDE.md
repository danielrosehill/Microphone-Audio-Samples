This repository is intended to serve two purposes. The first is to keep a selection of audio recordings for different microphones that I might use occasionally to provide a short sample of the audio. The second purpose is to conduct a benchmark assessing the difference that microphone selection and quality makes upon the accuracy of speech to text, comparing both local STT models as well as cloud inference. 
For that reason, the audio samples will be of the same text about the history of coffee in this repository. I'll use the notes folder to jot down details of the microphone that was used to generate a specific audio sample, as well as any additional parameters such as the recording distance, the setup, etc. If I try some permutations like recording several samples with the same microphone but With different microphone positioning then we should record this information in the meta data. 
I'm recording the microphone manufacturer and model number as well. This information is useful because it can be used to capture approximate quality and cost estimates for the microphone. The microphones I have in my collection vary widely from high quality to much lower quality test devices that I picked up from websites like Aliexpress. And to the extent that objective parameters can be calculated regarding the audio quality, that may be useful in comparing between the samples for this purpose, given that they will all be recorded in a relatively stable sound environment. Then add those to the evaluation and to the metadata profile. For example, it would be useful for example, to come up with a scoring system that we can use in order to attempt to objectively provide the microphone with a rating for the quality of audio it provides from the perspective of being a useful input in speech to text. We should also categorize the microphones, as some of them will be headsets while others will be desktop microphones, varying between types within those classes. OS is Ubuntyu 25.10 .Unless otherwise stated recording into Audacity. And I will provide connection method where appropriate.
